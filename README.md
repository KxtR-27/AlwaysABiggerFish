## Overview
Always A Bigger Fish is an arcade-style game in which the player controls a small fish. 
In the game are many other non-controlled fishes of varying sizes, as well as some other animals.
The player must eat fish that are smaller than them and avoid *being eaten* by fish *bigger* than them.

When the player eats (collides with and deletes) a smaller fish, their size increases slightly depending upon the size of what they ate.
Likewise, when the player is eaten (collides with and *gets* deleted), the game is immediately over.

The player's goal is to reach the biggest size they can within a 30-second[^1] round.
When the round is over--either by running out of time or by getting eaten--return to title screen.

The bigger grows and the smaller fish is deleted. If collides with any collectible, increase own size. |
| Fish Sprite              | Holds a value for an image and a size. Configured to despawn when offscreen. Configured for player collisions. Allows for more specific behaviors for subclasses. | As of now, none                                                                                           | Time needed to cross a boundary, or get eaten.

A check is run to see whose size is bigger. The bigger grows and the smaller fish is deleted.                                                   |
| Fish Sprite > BasicFish  | Many "types" of fish use this. The "type" of fish is chosen randomly from a gallery of pictures.

They spawn at a random y-level. Speed range differs based on fish "type." | Inherit                       | Inherit                                                                                                                                                                       |
